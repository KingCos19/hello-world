Just another repository

Hey MacDaddy! This is Cos coming at you with a repository! I know, the world of computer science JUST KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER!
Hopefully we do well on the CS 132 Exam (because it is currently the friday before the exam :P). Hope to play
some smash bros soon. 

See you tomorrow bud!

Best,
Cos
